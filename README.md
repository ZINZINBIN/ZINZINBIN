### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jinsu Kim

About me
===
I'm a mechanical and aerospace engineering graduate student at Princeton University, focusing on nuclear fusion plasma control. My academic interests are plasma physics (transport and pedestal physics) and physics-informed machine learning. 

For my undergraduate, I majored in nuclear engineering and physics, researching the effect of RMP on electron heat transport in KSTAR. My current prioritized academic topics are understanding the transport phenomenon and physics-informed data-driven modeling for plasma transport. In addition, AI applications in nuclear fusion, including plasma disruption prediction and zeroth order plasma dynamic modeling and control based on PINN and RL have been covered during my master's research. I share several works on my GitHub. Please see and share your opinions.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research, work, or anything else you want to know about me.
